I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Convergence IT Engineering at POSTECH. Currently I belong to the Efficient Computing Lab. under instructor Prof. Eunhyeok Park. 

I received my B.S. from POSTECH in Creative IT Engineering. 

I am interested in the optimization of neural networks, especially large language models (LLMs) and binary neural networks. I am working on the quantization and fine-tuning of large language models these days.
