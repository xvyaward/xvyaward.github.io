I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Convergence IT Engineering at POSTECH. Currently I belong to the Efficient Computing Lab. under instructor Prof. Eunhyeok Park. 

I received my B.S. from POSTECH in the Department of Creative IT Engineering. 

I am researching on improving the **efficiency and performance** of **large language models (LLMs)**. Recently, my focus has been on LLM quantization, efficient fine-tuning, and enhancing long-context abilities. In addition to this, I am also interested in overall neural network quantization, Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), and efficient hardware accelerators â€” all of which I have actively researched.

I am currently seeking internship and job opportunities! If you're interested, please feel free to contact me.
